# web-scrapping-project
We can extract information from any website using this scrapping project. I have scrapped information from github.com/topics.
This project is useful for data analysis because we can extract all the useful information from any website you wish just in one
eye blink.
This project is made using only python.
I used to extract top topics from github.
I also extracted for every single topic top rated user and his repositories and total number of star he have.
I also extracted link of his profile.
I have used some python library like beautyfulSoup.
